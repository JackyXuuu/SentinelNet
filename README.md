## What is our project?
The permanence and immutability of blockchain transactions can be a double-edged sword. Once a transaction goes through, there’s no taking it back. Today, millions of wallets are stolen through phishing: fake mint sites, free airdrops, scam deals that claim for users to “send 1 eth get 2 back.”

In light of the complexity of understanding NFT transactions and the sheer scope of scamming in this space, newcomers of blockchain are left vulnerable. Even seasoned traders are not above getting scooped into a sophisticated scam. Scam protection is a top priority for both newcomers and veterans in the web3 space.


## How do you run it?
In order to run the proxy server for the wallet
```
cd walletserver
node index.js
```

If you wish to run the react website with the transaction logs (make sure you are in the root directory):
```
npm run start
```
